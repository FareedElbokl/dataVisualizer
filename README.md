Software: Student Data Visualizing Tool V1.0

##Description

Software designed to extract and manipulate Data from text/csv files. Data can be loaded from files, this data can then be sorted (or other tasks can be done) to the user's preference through an interactive user interface or a batch user interface. Data can also be loaded from a file then graphed as a histogram or through obtaining the equation of the line based on the data.

##Dependencies

Check that the latest version of Python is installed, if not, install it through pythons website https://www.python.org/. 

install Matplotlib and NumPy libraries

Installing matplotlib and numpy in the terminal:
C:> python -m pip install matplotlib
C:> python -m pip install numpy

##installation

An integrated development environment (IDE) that supports python is required.
Wing IDE is a recommended example.
The user should have a text/csv file with data that they wish to analyze/process.

1. Unzip the file downloaded from brightspace.
2. Open Batch_UI.py in the IDE if you wish to use a text file based user interface.
3. Open text_UI in the IDE if you wish to give the inputs yourself.
4. Run the program in the python console, you should see the interface in the python console and be prompted to either enter a file name or a command (depending on your choice of user interface).


##Usage

Refer to user video.
